      <description>Ever since I started grad school, I have been fascinated by the idea of no-regret algorithms. It is truly remarkable that one can make sequential decisions with very little or no assumptions at all about the future and still manage to do almost as well as if you have known the future in advance.

&#34;when I finally understood what no-regret guarantees entailed&#34;  So, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending much time trying to develop some intuition behind these algorithms in general by reading blogs, lecture notes, and some papers.</description>

      <title>The Monitor Argument: 2. Proof Sketch</title>

      <description>In the previous post, we went over three different settings and saw how they can all be understood under one unifying framework. In this post, we will first go over the high level proof sketch, and then we will prove all the lemmas that are not specific to the setting.

Proof Sketch Here&amp;rsquo;s the statement that we want to prove: $$ \Pr_{S \sim \mathcal{P}^n, q = M(S)}\left( |q(S) - E_{S \sim \mathcal{P}^n} \left[ q(S) \right] | \ge \alpha \right) \le \beta.</description>

      <description>In this post, I want to go over the Monitor argument introduced by Bassily et al.; it was originally developed in order to show strong generalization bounds for differentially private algorithms even in the face of adaptivity.
I first learned about the Monitor argument when I took Aaron&amp;rsquo;s Adaptive Data Analysis class back in Fall 2017 but have forgotten about it since then. However, when I recently read Steinke et al.</description>
